# Description
Another ~stupid~ implementation of Conways's Game of Life written in Rust language.

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

# Motivation
Use a more complex example than 'hello world' to learn a new language.

# Usage

Shortly:

```
cargo build --release
cargo run
```

You need the Rust environment to build this repository. Specifically the Rust Compiler `rustc` and the Rust package manager `cargo`. You can download both on the official website of the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) or in the official repositories of your operating system.
